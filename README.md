ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @alessandrovaru

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m deeply passionate about Full Stack Development, with a particular focus on Ruby On Rails, React, HTML, CSS, Javascript, NextJS and GatsbyJS.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently dedicating most of my time to developing with NextJS, especially at La Pizarra del DT, where I'm leading the migration of the entire platform from React with Create React App to NextJS, paired with a Ruby on Rails API, a language I'm also proficient in.

ðŸ’» In addition to my proficiency in NextJS and Ruby on Rails, I am skilled in using a variety of technologies including Firebase, Heroku, AWS, Vercel, Netlify, Webflow, and Bootstrap. While I may not have mastered all these technologies to perfection, I am adept at understanding and utilizing their documentation.

ðŸ“± Alongside my frontend work, I'm exploring mobile app development and am involved in creating a Meditation Mobile App using React Native.
